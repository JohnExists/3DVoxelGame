## Introduction
This project is a 3D sandbox game inspired by the popular game "Minecraft". Players spawn in a procedurally generated block world with the freedom to build and destroy to their heart's content. This project is created in C++ using the OpenGL API through GLFW and Glad. The timespan that this project took was 3 months in between March and June of 2022.
### Features
* Efficient use of object-oriented programming principles
* CMake Integration For Cross Platform Building
* Randomly generated "Natural-looking" worlds
* Far away terrain is covered in fog
* Proper object colission between the player and the world
* Unique biomes to switch up the terrain (Plains, Forests, Desert, Ocean)
* The ability for the player to traverse arround this world
* Block breaking and block placing any block available in the world
* Inventory system allowing the player to swap between which blocks they want to place
* Seamless UI allowing for a seamless user experience

## Skills Developed
#### Through this project I was introduced to numerous technologies. Here are some of the new technologies I learned:
* C++ And Its Object-Oriented Properties
* Performance Optimization in 3D Graphics
* GLFW and Glad to allow communication with the OpenGL API
* Git and GitHub for proper version control
* Matrix and Vector Manipulation in the context of 3D Graphics
* Large-Scale Project Management
* Utilizing JSON to read and extract data

## How To Build (For MinGW)
